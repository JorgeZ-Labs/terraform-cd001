# 🚀 GitHub Workflows: Terraform Infrastructure Provisioning

This repository includes GitHub Actions workflows to provision and manage Azure infrastructure using Terraform. Follow these steps to install the GitHub CLI (`gh`) and run workflows locally.

---

## 📦 Prerequisites

- GitHub CLI: [Install Guide](https://cli.github.com/manual/installation)
- Logged in to GitHub via `gh` CLI
- Access to the repository `ivan-sample-org/terraform-cd`

---

## 🔧 Setup

### 1. Install the GitHub CLI

#### macOS
```bash
brew install gh
```

#### Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
sudo apt install gh
```

#### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
winget install --id GitHub.cli
```

Or see the full [installation instructions](https://cli.github.com/manual/installation).

---

### 2. Authenticate with GitHub

```bash
gh auth login
```

Choose:
- `GitHub.com`
- `HTTPS`
- Authenticate via browser or use a Personal Access Token (PAT)

Check your authentication:
```bash
gh auth status
```
Expected output:
```
github.com
  ✓ Logged in to github.com as YOUR_USERNAME (keyring)
  ✓ Git operations for github.com configured to use https protocol.
  ✓ Token: ***
  ✓ Token scopes: gist, read:org, repo, workflow
```

---

### 3. Switch GitHub Account (if needed)

If you're logged in as the wrong GitHub user:

```bash
gh auth logout
gh auth login
```

Then repeat the authentication steps above with the correct account.

## 📤 Running a Workflow

To trigger a workflow manually using the GitHub CLI:

### 🔀 Example Workflow: `base-provision-workflow-v2.yaml`

```bash
gh workflow run base-provision-workflow-v2.yaml \
  --ref feature/RA-POD-000_addind_reuseful_actions \
  -f environment=uat \
  -f mode=apply
```

> 💡 Make sure the workflow file exists in `.github/workflows/` and is committed in the branch you're referencing with `--ref`.

gh run watch           # Live view of a running workflow
```

## 💬 Troubleshooting

- ❌ **404 Not Found** when running or listing workflows?
  - Confirm you're in the right repo folder: `cd terraform-cd`
  - Or explicitly set the repo:
    ```bash
    gh workflow list -R ivan-sample-org/terraform-cd
    ```

- ❌ **Workflow not found**?
  - Use `gh workflow list` to get the actual name or ID of the workflow.

- ⛔ **Permission errors**?
  - Ensure your token has `repo`, `workflow`, and `read:org` scopes.

- ⚠️ **Missing workflow file in the branch?**
  - Verify it exists with:
    ```bash
    git checkout feature/RA-POD-000_addind_reuseful_actions
    ls .github/workflows/
    ```
  - Make sure the file is committed and pushed:
    ```bash
    git add .github/workflows/base-provision-workflow-v2.yaml
    git commit -m "Add workflow"
    git push origin feature/RA-POD-000_addind_reuseful_actions
    ```
